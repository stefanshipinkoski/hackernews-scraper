A simple web scrape to scrape the first two pages of Hacker News https://news.ycombinator.com website for the newest posts which have a score of 100 or above and save them to a .txt file with a link to the post, title, and amount of points. They get sorted by the number of points starting with the highest

First please install the dependencies for the scraper by using the requirements.txt file:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

You can use this to get the highest-ranked, latest news on HackerNews website. Please clone this, and run the script in your Terminal ```python3  scrape_hackernews.py```, and open the news.txt file, which will be saved in the same repository as the scrape_hackernews.py, for your latest posts.
